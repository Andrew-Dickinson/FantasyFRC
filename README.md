Fantasy FRC is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport" target="_blank">fantasy sport</a> that uses match data from <a href="http://www.usfirst.org" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competion (FRC)</a> to allow users to select and manage fantasy alliances of FRC teams.

This implementation uses Google App engine in python to handle web requests and stores them in a High Resolution Datastore (HRD).

Fantasy FRC is in an early state of development and will likely be ready for beta 1.0 for the 2016 FRC season
